    "I think taking the test helped put into perspective what AP Collegeboard wants from students, and how different it is from what we are doing in class with APIs and databases. It was easier than I had expected, it I could use test-taking strategies to figure out the different legislative acts instead of code. The AP pseudo-code was also a bit confusing, but I think taking the test helped me figure it out as I got used to it. Overall, it was an interesting learning experience, and helped me figure out a lot about robot code and the laws that regulate code. "
