    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Our team decided on a webstie based on fitness, since many people are becoming more and more interested in their health since diabetes is becoming a problem. By exercising, eating healthy, sleeping, and keeping track of daily habits, people will be better able to take care of tehmselves and their lifestyles. While we originally thought about a Star Wars or Taylor Swift theme, we thought fitness wold be more helpful, and were able to collaborated on the website and help others. \n",

    "## My Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the login featues provided in class as a reference, I created a sleep funciton to help people keep track of their sleep scheudle and maintain their health. By inputting the amount of sleep they got, they can see the related data that is kept in the backend. By helping people improve their sleep schedules, I can keep them accountable for their own health, leading to happier users. The clause in teh database about sleep disorders can also help people feel less alone in their problems, and support the community while also improving people's health. This funciton, in conjunciton with the funcitons of the team, help people live their best lives, improving their overall health with a fun website. \n",
    "\n",
    "The feature itself asks users to input how much sleep they got, and then presents a table with people who got a similar amount of sleep, along with a reminder or encouragement to maintain a healthy sleep scheudle. People can also add their own information to the database to help other users. \n",
