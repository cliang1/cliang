## Tangibles

This week was really stressful, I didn't realized how much of a problem committing from various computers would be, especially when some pieces of code may or may not work before committing. 

Overall, we were able to actually present for NATM, and we finally got our API frontend to look good. It was a bit of a rush, but we were able to organize everything to look cleaner, and link all the pages on the homepage. I think we were having trouble defining the path, since we kept changing the names of the files and making new files or delteing them.
