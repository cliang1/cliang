# Project Overview
Read over Pair Showcase Criteria, Linux Shell and Bash, Python IO, Python Tricks!, JS Output w/Jquery, JS Output w/Objects, JS Input, and develop individualized projects for each, based on the skills learned. (ex. algorithm for median)

# Team Members
Developer 1: Cindy Liang
Developer 2: Aditi Bharadwaj

# Project Objectives
- Develop an algorithm for median based on Python Tricks
    - Use Python
- Create working plan for the week and check w/ peers and teachers
- Explore various computer languages (python, HTML, JS, etc.)
- Improve and innovate until the standards of the Pair Showcase are reached

# Project Tasks and Timeline

1. Integrate feedback from previous Live Review  <p>This is a grinning face emoji: &#128512;</p>
    - Tangibles files
    - Re-organize tables
    - Check w/Aditi to make sure files are in the right place
2. Read over Pair Showcase criteria, talk w/ Aditi about how to implemnt
    - make sure plan is doable
3. Divide and conquer the work (JS Output w/Obejects), and confer w/ Aditi afterwards
    - start individualized projects (medain algorithm, etc.)
    - Follow hacks
    - Talk w/ Aditi when confused (which is often)
4. Run everything, make sure it works
5. Practice presenting (passing off topics to partner, etc.) and review Showcase criteria
