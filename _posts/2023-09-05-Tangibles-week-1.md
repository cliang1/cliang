### This Week 8/21/23
I learned that it is really, really important and key to read the instructions on the Blog. Many of the questions I had could be easily answered on the blog. I also learned to go step by step in the directions and to be sure not to skip any steps. Additionally, I learned to keep updating my partner, Aditi, on what I had gotten through each day and to see if she needed help with anything I had done. I learnt the importance of asking my peers and teacher for help if I had any problems in my code.
