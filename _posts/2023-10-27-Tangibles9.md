## Tangibles

I think We did a lot this week, Eshika and I worked really closely together to fix the backend and connect it to the frontend. Since we got two databases, we were trying to display the data in different graphs and we messed up a few parts of the frontend through issues with committing. The basic code for the pie graph was interesting to figure out, espeically since we drew the numbers from the backend. THings finally started coming together, and we began to think about how to present everything coherently.
