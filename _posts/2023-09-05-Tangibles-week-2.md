### This Week 8/28/23
I learned that the internet and Chat GPT is a good way to check code for errors and feedback on the code. I learned that to put a python file into the blog, it had to go in Notebooks not Posts. This is because Python files have to be .ipynb file, not a .md file. I also learnt to be a better collaborator with Aditi; we often shared code and made separate edits to it to see which would work best. I noticed how the material gone over in the Tech Talks was very important and I often used that information while I coded throughout the day
