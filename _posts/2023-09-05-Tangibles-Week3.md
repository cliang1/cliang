### This Week 9/4/23
I realized the importance of having a detailed plan that was shared with your partner. This plan served as a guide for what we should do for the rest of the week and made it very easy to get our tasks done. I learned that we shouldn't put off tasks and instead do it there and then. For example, I put of learning how to get the table working until Friday, which left me less time to work on it with my partner. Overall, I learned how to use the internet better for the questions I had pertaining to my code (and how to describe my issue to Google). I also learned how important it was to read through the Hacks posted on the website.
